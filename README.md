# üß≥ TripVault ‚Äì A Personal Travel Diary

TripVault is a full-stack **MERN** application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that acts as a personal digital travel diary.

Users can securely sign up and log in to create, view, edit, and delete their trip entries. Each trip entry can store a title, destination, dates, and notes. The app also supports **photo uploads** (via Cloudinary) and **searchable tags** (like "beach" or "solo"). The main dashboard displays all trips as cards, which can be **filtered or searched** by destination or tag.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.  
You will need **two servers** running ‚Äî one for frontend and one for backend.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- MongoDB (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- Cloudinary account (for image hosting)

---

### 1. Backend Setup (`/server`)

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   cd server
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Create a `.env` file in `/server` and add your environment variables (see below).  
4. Start the backend:
npm run dev # if you use nodemon
or
npm start
The backend will run on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

---

### 2. Frontend Setup (`/client`)

1. In a new terminal window:
  cd client
2. Install dependencies:
  npm install
3. Create a `.env.local` file in `/client` (see below).  
4. Start the React development server:
The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is deployed in two parts:

### **Backend (Render)**
- Deploy `/server` folder as a **Web Service** on Render.
- **Root Directory:** `server`  
- **Start Command:** `node server.js`
- Update `CLIENT_URL` in Render environment variables to your live Vercel URL (e.g., `https://tripvault.vercel.app`).

### **Frontend (Vercel)**
- Deploy `/client` as a **Vite Project** on Vercel.  
- **Root Directory:** `client`  
- Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in environment variables to your Render API URL (e.g., `https://tripvault-api.onrender.com`).
- Add a `client/vercel.json` file to fix React Router refresh issues.

---

## üìñ API Endpoints

All API requests are prefixed with your base URL  
(e.g., `http://localhost:5001` or `https://tripvault-api.onrender.com`).

### **User Routes**
- `POST /api/users/register` ‚Äì Register a new user  
- `POST /api/users/login` ‚Äì Log in a user  

### **Trip Routes**
